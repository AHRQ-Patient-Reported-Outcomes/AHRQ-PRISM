If you really want to get your foot behind your head during your workout for some reason or have other range of motion desires, stretch beforehand.</p>

      <p class="content-text">There are a number of different types of stretching, like dynamic, static, ballistic, and beyond. But there are two main types you want to focus on and know about: dynamic and static.</p>
      <p class="content-text">Static stretching is what a lot of people think of when they think of stretching. This is holding a position that goes just past your point of comfort for about 30 seconds and repeating it two to three times. Think of the standard quad stretch when you stand on one leg, bend the other knee, and grab that foot. Dynamic stretching is often done before exercise. Done correctly, dynamic stretches warm up muscles and lubricate joints. A good example is swinging your arms across your chest, back and forth, prior to doing pushups.</p>
